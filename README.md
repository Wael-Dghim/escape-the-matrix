## Concept

In the Matrix, you have to guess the key correctly to escape. If a digit from the number you enter is existent but not in the correct position in the key, that counts as a blue pill. If a digit is correct and in the same position in the key, that counts as a red pill. The goal is to get 4 red pills to escape the Matrix and enter Paradise.
